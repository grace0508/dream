    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery">Robot-assisted surgery or robotic surgery
        are any types of surgical procedures that are performed using robotic systems. Robotically assisted surgery was
        developed to try to overcome the limitations of pre-existing minimally-invasive surgical procedures and to
        enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery.</blockquote>

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The concept of using standard hand grips to control manipulators and cameras of various sizes down to
        sub-miniature was described in the Robert Heinlein story 'Waldo' in August 1942, which also mentioned brain
        surgery. The first robot to assist in surgery was the Arthrobot, which was developed and used for the first time
        in Vancouver in 1983. This robot assisted in being able to manipulate and position the patient's leg on voice
        command. Intimately involved were biomedical engineer James McEwen, Geof Auchinleck, a UBC engineering physics
        grad, and Dr. Brian Day as well as a team of engineering students. The robot was used in an orthopaedic surgical
        procedure on 12 March 1983, at the UBC Hospital in Vancouver. The next great step was in 1985. in brain biopsy
        under CT guidance with the assistance of a robotic arm—PUMA560. Over 60 arthroscopic surgical procedures were
        performed in the first 12 months, and a 1985. National Geographic video on industrial robots, The Robotics
        Revolution, featured the device. Other related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical
        scrub nurse robot, which handed operative instruments on voice command, and a medical laboratory robotic arm. A
        YouTube video entitled Arthrobot – the world's first surgical robot illustrates some of these in operation.</p>
    <h2>COMPARISON TO TRADITIONAL METHODS</h2>
    <p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery">Major advances aided by surgical robots have
        been remote surgery, minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done
        with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time.
        Articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification help to result in improved
        ergonomics. Due to these techniques, there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss, transfusions,
        and use of pain medication. The existing open surgery technique has many flaws such as limited access to the
        surgical area, long recovery time, long hours of operation, blood loss, surgical scars, and marks.

        The robot's costs range from $1 million to $2.5 million for each unit, and while its disposable supply cost is
        normally $1,500 per procedure, the cost of the procedure is higher.Additional surgical training is needed to
        operate the system. Numerous feasibility studies have been done to determine whether the purchase of such
        systems are worthwhile. As it stands, opinions differ dramatically. Surgeons report that, although the
        manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and
        surgeons must perform 150 to 250 procedures to become adept in their use. During the training phase, minimally
        invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie-ups and
        surgical staffs keeping patients under anesthesia for longer periods. Patient surveys indicate they chose the
        procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity, improved outcomes, reduced blood loss and less
        pain.Higher expectations may explain higher rates of dissatisfaction and regret.

        Compared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted surgery gives the surgeon better
        control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site. In addition, surgeons no longer
        have to stand throughout the surgery and do not get tired as quickly. Naturally occurring hand tremors are
        filtered out by the robot's computer software. Finally, the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating
        surgery teams. Laparoscopic camera positioning is also significantly steadier with less inadvertent movements
        under robotic controls than compared to human assistance. The use of mixed reality to support robot-assisted
        surgery was developed at the Air Force Research Laboratory in 1992 through the creation of "virtual fixtures"
        that overlay virtual boundaries or guides that assist the human operator and has become a common method for
        increasing safety and precision.

        There are some issues in regards to current robotic surgery usage in clinical applications. There is a lack of
        haptics in some robotic systems currently in clinical use, which means there is no force feedback, or touch
        feedback. No interaction between the instrument and the patient is felt. However, recently the Senhance robotic
        system by Asensus Surgical was developed with haptic feedback in order to improve the interaction between the
        surgeon and the tissue.

        The robots can also be very large, have instrumentation limitations, and there may be issues with multi-quadrant
        surgery as current devices are solely used for single-quadrant application.

        Critics of the system, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,say there is a steep
        learning curve for surgeons who adopt the use of the system and that there's a lack of studies that indicate
        long-term results are superior to results following traditional laparoscopic surgery.Articles in the newly
        created Journal of Robotic Surgery tend to report on one surgeon's experience.

        Complications related to robotic surgeries range from converting the surgery to open, re-operation, permanent
        injury, damage to viscera and nerve damage. From 2000 to 2011, out of 75 hysterectomies done with robotic
        surgery, 34 had permanent injury, and 49 had damage to the viscera. [citation needed] Prostatectomies were more
        prone to permanent injury, nerve damage and visceral damage as well. Very minimal surgeries in a variety of
        specialties had to actually be converted to open or be re-operated on, but most did sustain some kind of damage
        or injury. For example, out of seven coronary artery bypass grafting, one patient had to go under re-operation.
        It is important that complications are captured, reported and evaluated to ensure the medical community is
        better educated on the safety of this new technology. If something was to go wrong in a robot-assisted surgery,
        it is difficult to identify culpability, and the safety of the practice will influence how quickly and
        widespread these practices are used.[citation needed]

        One drawback of the use of robotic surgery is the risk of mechanical failure of the system and instruments. A
        study from July 2005 to December 2008 was conducted to analyze the mechanical failures of the da Vinci Surgical
        System at a single institute. During this period, a total of 1797 robotic surgeries were performed used 4 da
        Vinci surgical systems. There were 43 cases (2.4%) of mechanical failure, including 24 (1.3%) cases of
        mechanical failure or malfunction and 19 (1.1%) cases of instrument malfunction. Additionally, one open and two
        laparoscopic conversions (0.17%) were performed. Therefore, the chance of mechanical failure or malfunction was
        found to be rare, with the rate of converting to an open or laparoscopic procedure very low.

        There are also current methods of robotic surgery being marketed and advertised online. Removal of a cancerous
        prostate has been a popular treatment through internet marketing. Internet marketing of medical devices are more
        loosely regulated than pharmaceutical promotions. Many sites that claim the benefits of this type of procedure
        had failed to mention risks and also provided unsupported evidence. There is an issue with government and
        medical societies promotion a production of balanced educational material. In the US alone, many websites
        promotion robotic surgery fail to mention any risks associated with these types of procedures, and hospitals
        providing materials largely ignore risks, overestimate benefits and are strongly influenced by the manufacturer.

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery">Since April 2018, medical insurance coverage
        was expanding in Japan, so doctors were considering promoting the procedure for cardiac surgery, as it has the
        advantage of reducing the burden on the patient. Japanese drama Black Pean takes on this challenge, showing both
        sides' point of view. Two University Hospitals are competing to be the best in the Cardiac Surgery Department.
        One, Tojo, has the best traditional surgeons, while the other, Teika, is all about researching and implementing
        the most recent technology. With this, Teika sends its technical specialist to Tojo to try to convince them to
        update their techniques, including the use of the Da Vinci robot (named in the drama as Darwin). Newhart
        Watanabe International Hospital, a pioneer in da Vinci surgery for the heart in Japan, was used as background
        for the drama, with Dr. Gou Watanabe providing technical support.</blockquote>
